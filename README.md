open with /aetherdraw  <br>
add to repo, (if not showing on experimental tab, check the get testing builds at the top). If still not showing add manually: <br>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rail2025/AetherDraw/refs/heads/master/repo.json <br>
<br>
You can save the plans as editable plans using the save/load plan buttons, and send those files to other users so they can edit. <br>
OR<br>
You can save the plans as flat images(no editing). If you have 4 pages saved as "boss phase 1", it will get saved as 1-boss phase 1.png, 2-boss phase 1.png, 3-boss phase 1.png, etc. <br>
OR<br>
You can create/join a live session and collaborate with other AetherDraw users in real time (roughly 3 sec sync after last drawn image)
<br>
If you save as image file into the PluginImages folder for WDIGViewer, when you use the open WDIG button and rescan/reload all images, the raid plan images will appear there so you can use it right away!
<br>
WDIGViewer is here:<br>

<br>
BUT Networking/live collaboration development is still underway XD<br>
