# AetherDraw
AetherDraw is a XivLauncher/Dalamud plugin.

AetherDraw allows you to create and share multi-page strategy diagrams for raid and trial encounters, either by saving plan files or collaborating with other users in a real-time live session. AetherDraw is designed for raid leaders and players who need a clear, visual way to explain and understand encounter mechanics.

The goal of this plugin is to make complex strategies easier to communicate by providing a shared visual whiteboard.

AetherDraw is for creating and collaborating on plans. For displaying the saved images as an in-game reference during a fight, please use the companion plugin, [WDIGViewer](https://github.com/rail2025/WDIGViewer).

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rail2025/AetherDraw/refs/heads/master/repo.json

<br>
## Bottom bar buttons:
<br>
- You can save the plans as editable plans using the save/load plan buttons, and send those files to other users so they can edit. <br>
<br>
- You can save the plans as flat images(no editing). If you have 4 pages saved as "boss phase 1", it will get saved as 1-boss phase 1.png, 2-boss phase 1.png, 3-boss phase 1.png, etc. <br>
<br>
- You can create/join a live session and collaborate with other AetherDraw users in real time (images update after mouse release) <br>

## >>>>for party quick sync, you must be in a party, and in a duty. For passphrase, there is no such restriction.
                                                                                                                  
<br>
- If you save as image file into the PluginImages folder for WDIGViewer, when you use the open WDIG button and rescan/reload all images, the raid plan images will appear there so you can use it right away! WDIGViewer is here: https://github.com/rail2025/WDIGViewer


<br> The passphrase is a random FFXIV themed sentence that should be safe to paste in chat with plausible deniability. You may use your own passphrase, 123abc123, hotdogsaresandwiches, Lalafels are potatoes in disguise, etc. The plugin just makes it more convenient to share in game.

#### Be aware there are NO user lists, or any way to identify who drew anything in the plugin. This is by design to protect your anonymity. This comes with some tradeoffs, but such is life.
